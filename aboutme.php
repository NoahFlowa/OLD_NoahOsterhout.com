                <p style="color: #71767F; font-size: 1.5em;">I am currently pursuing my last semester at Ferris State University for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Systems.  I also love to hang out with my friends in beautiful Traverse City, Michigan and play on my custom built gaming PC.  I also love to dabble in Game Creation with Unreal Engine 5 and even Virtual and Augmented Reality with my Meta Quest 2 and the HTC Vive.</p>
